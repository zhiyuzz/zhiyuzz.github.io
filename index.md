Hello! I am a final year PhD student at Boston University, advised by Prof. [Yannis Paschalidis](https://sites.bu.edu/paschalidis/people/yannis-paschalidis/) and Prof. [Ashok Cutkosky](https://ashok.cutkosky.com/).

I am broadly interested in the theoretical aspects of machine learning, optimization and control theory. Specifically, I work on adaptive online learning, i.e., designing online decision making algorithms that optimally exploit problem structures. 

Recently I am thinking about how to systematically simplify (and eventually automate) the design and verification of online learning algorithms, from an emerging continuous-time perspective. **I am looking for a postdoc position starting in Fall 2023.** 

Prior to BU, I studied mechanical engineering at Tsinghua University.
