Hello! I am a PhD student at Boston University, advised by Prof. [Yannis Paschalidis](https://sites.bu.edu/paschalidis/people/yannis-paschalidis/) and Prof. [Ashok Cutkosky](https://ashok.cutkosky.com/).

I am broadly interested in the theoretical aspects of machine learning, optimization and control theory. Specifically, I work on adaptive online learning, i.e., designing online decision making algorithms that optimally exploit problem structures.

Prior to BU, I studied mechanical engineering at Tsinghua University.

## Research

The latest versions are available on arXiv. The code of my published papers is on Github.

 - [**Optimal Parameter-free Online Learning with Switching Cost**](https://arxiv.org/abs/2205.06846)<br>
**ZZ**, Ashok Cutkosky, Ioannis Paschalidis.<br>
NeurIPS 2022. Also presented at ICML 2022 workshop. 
> We design parameter-free algorithms in the presence of switching costs. Using a dual space scaling strategy, our algorithm effectively balances these two opposite considerations, improving the existing regret bound to the optimal rate.

 - [**PDE-Based Optimal Strategy for Unconstrained Online Learning**](https://arxiv.org/abs/2201.07877)<br>
**ZZ**, Ashok Cutkosky, Ioannis Paschalidis.<br>
ICML 2022.
> We design a parameter-free online learning algorithm by solving a PDE. Our framework requires less guessing than prior approaches, and the obtained regret bound achieves the optimal leading constant for the first time.

- [**Adversarial Tracking Control via Strongly Adaptive Online Learning with Memory**](https://arxiv.org/abs/2102.01623)<br>
**ZZ**, Ashok Cutkosky, Ioannis Paschalidis.<br>
AISTATS 2022.
> We reveal a connection between two separate notions of "tracking" in online learning and linear control. Through several new results in adaptive online learning, we propose a controller that tracks an adversarially generated state sequence with a strong guarantee.

- [**Provable Hierarchical Imitation Learning via EM**](https://arxiv.org/abs/2010.03133)<br>
**ZZ**, Ioannis Paschalidis.<br>
AISTATS 2021. Also presented at ICML 2020 Workshop.
> We use the framework of Expectation-Maximization to analyze the learning of a hierarchical policy from expert demonstrations.
