Hello! I'm an assistant professor at Zhejiang University working on the **foundations of data science and automation**. 

**Bio.**&nbsp;&nbsp; Previously I did my phd at Boston University, advised by [Yannis Paschalidis](https://sites.bu.edu/paschalidis/people/yannis-paschalidis/) and [Ashok Cutkosky](https://ashok.cutkosky.com/). After that I did postdoc at Harvard University hosted by [Heng Yang](https://hankyang.seas.harvard.edu/), and at Carnegie Mellon University hosted by [Aaditya Ramdas](https://www.stat.cmu.edu/~aramdas/). Long ago I did my undergrad at Tsinghua University. 

**Research.**&nbsp;&nbsp; My research focuses on algorithmic problems at the intersection of optimization, statistics, and game theory. In particular, I enjoy (i) drawing connections across these areas to derive simple, interpretable, and quantitatively strong algorithms from first principles; and (ii) developing theory that leads, rather than follows, the state-of-the-art practice in data science. With collaborators, my group also explores a range of downstream applications with real-world impact, including GenAI, robotics, energy systems, and economics. 

**Group.**&nbsp;&nbsp; I'm fortunate to lead a warm, supportive and intellectually stimulating research group, which also includes the following members. 

 - PhD students: Yukun Wang (王钰琨)

 - MS students: Yiming Sun (孙一鸣)

**Please reach out if you are interested in joining us!** We also have a weekly group meeting that focuses on understanding fundamental topics in data science. It is open to all, and please reach out to learn more.
